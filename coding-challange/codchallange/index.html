        <h3>HTML Summary</h3>

        <p>
          Our page's content, structure, and meaning are all defined using HTML
          (HyperText Markup Language).<br />
          You don't use it for styling purposes. Instead, use CSS for that!
        </p>
        <p class="cizgi">HTML uses "elements" to describe (annotate) content</p>
        <p>
          Typically, HTML elements have an opening tag, content, and a closing
          tag.
        </p>
        <p class="cizgi">You can also have void (empty) elements like images</p>

        <p class="cizgi">You can also configure elements with attribute</p>

        <p>
          There's a long list of available elements but you'll gain experience
          over time, no worries.There's a long list of available elements but

        <h3>CSS Summary</h3>

        <p>
          You can style the content of your page by using CSS (Cascading Style
          Sheets)
        </p>
        <p>To assign styles, use property value pairs.</p>
        <p>By using the "style" attribute, you can assign styles.</p>

        <p class="cizgi">
          Typically, global styles (such as those provided by the "style"
          element) are used to prevent code duplication
        </p>

        <p>
          A different option is to use external stylesheet files that you "link"
          to " .
        </p>
        <p class="cizgi">
          Understanding terms like "inheritance," "specificity," and "the box
          model" is essential while dealing with CSS
        </p>
